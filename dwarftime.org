* legends browser makes me sad
* first look at the structure of the dfhack export - xq (but really jq)
** jq is an insanely useful tool to look at large amounts of json
** can't always rely on spot check or your text editor, especially with 88mb of text
** google "shape of json jq" "all paths in json jq"
** but wait, this is xml?
** enter xq
* wow, it looks really normal (db kind)
** a list of collections of items
** some funniness in structures and historical events
** understandable, most columns live in historical events
* to sqlite for !!further analysis!!
** write some python to ingest the XM
*** google a little function to dump etree into json
*** use this to cheat when we recurse too far into the weeds
*** iterate over the first level of collections, but if we see any other deeper collections, just dump json into a column
*** should be fine, right?
** sqlite3 is fast! everyone already knows this
*** but lightning fast for this purpose, with proper transactions
** is perfect for small amount of data, and a script to deploy to people who don't want to set up a 'real' db
* OK, lets make a map
** rivers
*** five integers per point in sequence
*** X, Y biome then X,Y,Z tile in biome
*** end biome tile instead of endpoint
*** rivers flow to specific ocean biome tiles
** regions
*** region boundaries are the largest "tile" size
*** will provide the background of our map
*** second largest tile size are "embark" tiles
*** DONE how many embark tiles per "world" tile?

**** wiki says 768 square. this seems to make sense for rivers?
**** But sites have larger dimensions
**** turns out rivers have even bigger dimensions than sites
**** dfhack dox had the answer: there is a separate grid for features
**** there are 2,304 "feature shell" grid squares in a region tile
***** used for sites/structures
**** there are 12,288 "local" cells in a region as well
***** rivers use this
*** each embark tile is 48x48 game tiles x/y
